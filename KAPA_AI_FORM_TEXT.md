# Kapa.ai Form Text - What problem are you trying to solve?

## English Version (Recommended)

```
We are developing CLIFF (Cosmic Level Intelligent Forecast Framework), a real-time space and Earth threat monitoring platform that won 1st place in NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 - Turkey Aksaray. Currently preparing for TÜBİTAK 4006 Science Fair and TÜBİTAK 2204 competitions.

Our platform integrates multiple NASA APIs (NeoWs, CNEOS, EONET, DONKI) to monitor asteroids, space weather, and natural disasters in real-time. We need an AI-powered documentation and support system to help students, educators, and technical teams understand the complex astronomical data, API integrations, threat assessment algorithms, and 3D visualization components.

The platform features Python/FastAPI backend, Next.js/React frontend with Three.js 3D visualizations, Google Gemini AI integration, and WebSocket real-time updates. We require intelligent documentation that can explain technical concepts, provide API usage examples, assist with troubleshooting, and help users understand the scientific background behind space threats and Earth events.

Our goal is to make space science accessible to students while maintaining technical accuracy, and we need an AI assistant that can bridge the gap between complex NASA data and educational understanding.

## Alternative Shorter Version

```
Building an AI-powered documentation and support system for CLIFF, our award-winning NASA Space Apps Challenge project (1st Place - Turkey Aksaray). The platform monitors real-time space and Earth threats using NASA APIs, featuring 3D visualizations, AI analysis, and educational tools. We need intelligent documentation that helps students and developers understand complex astronomical data, threat assessment algorithms, API integrations, and technical implementation details while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## Detailed Technical Version

```
CLIFF is a comprehensive real-time monitoring platform that integrates NASA's NeoWs, CNEOS, EONET, and DONKI APIs to track asteroids, space weather, and natural disasters. As winners of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 (Turkey Aksaray 1st Place), we're preparing for TÜBİTAK competitions and need an AI documentation system.

The platform consists of:
- FastAPI backend with async data processing pipelines
- Next.js frontend with Three.js 3D solar system visualization
- Google Gemini AI for threat analysis and educational content
- MongoDB for data persistence
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Multiple NASA API integrations requiring complex data normalization

We need AI assistance for:
1. Technical documentation explaining API integrations and data flows
2. Educational content explaining astronomical concepts to students
3. Troubleshooting guides for developers working with NASA APIs
4. Code examples and implementation patterns
5. Scientific explanations of threat assessment algorithms (Torino Scale, Palermo Scale)
6. User-friendly explanations of complex 3D visualization techniques

The AI should understand both technical implementation details and educational needs, helping bridge the gap between NASA's raw data and accessible learning materials for Turkish students participating in science fairs.
